A quick art project for a friend's gallery, it crawls around reddit randomly.

Starts on the reddit homepage, we navigate to a reddit page page scroll down a few time, 
and randomly selects links on the page (to other reddit pages) to add to a stack.
We pop a link of the stack and continue the process forever.

Built using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

Use chromedriver.exe for iOS and chromedriver_win.exe for Windows.

Modified from my [Twitter Scraper](https://github.com/Capital-News-Service/nba-twitter) project.
